A simple online version of Gramps

## Project vision
This project aims to produce a platform for collaborating on a shared genealogy tree. It should allow many people to edit the tree and keep track of changes.

The data produced through this collaborative process should be publicly accessible, part of our commonwealth, while respecting privacy of living persons.

## Design principles
The following principles guide decisions for design and development of this project.

- usability is paramount
  - it may be good to sacrifice some flexibility, so that end-users have an easy time
- write Pythonic code
    - e.g. follow the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
- follow well-documented Django conventions
